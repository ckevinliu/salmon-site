We're excited to launch the Salmon blog.

This is where we'll share what we're learning as we build the real-time data engine that keeps CRM records accurate, current, and trusted. Expect perspectives on the problems that keep revenue teams up at night — and how better data infrastructure can solve them.

## What we'll cover

Here's what you can expect to find here:

- **CRM data quality** — Why your contact records decay, what it costs you, and how to fix it at the source rather than the symptom.
- **Revenue operations** — Practical approaches to enrichment, routing, and scoring that actually move pipeline.
- **Compliance & KYC** — How real-time verification changes the game for regulated industries.
- **Product updates** — New capabilities, integrations, and under-the-hood improvements to the Salmon engine.
- **Industry analysis** — Our take on where B2B data infrastructure is heading.

## Why a blog?

We talk to revenue teams every day. The same questions come up again and again: *How do I know which records are stale? What's the real cost of bad data? How do I build a data stack that doesn't rot?*

We want to answer those questions in the open — not behind a gated PDF, not in a sales deck. Just clear, honest writing about the problems we care about.
