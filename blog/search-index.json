Here's why it happens, what it actually costs, and what you can do about it.","body":"if you&#39;ve ever pulled a report from your crm and wondered why half the phone numbers bounce and a quarter of the job titles are wrong, you&#39;re not imagining things. b2b contact data decays at a rate of 30–40% per year. people change jobs, companies merge, offices relocate, and your crm doesn&#39;t update itself. the math of decay let&#39;s say you have 100,000 contact records today. by this time next year: 30,000+ of those records will have at least one stale field 15,000 contacts will have changed companies 8,000 phone numbers will no longer connect 5,000 email addresses will hard-bounce this isn&#39;t a one-time cleanup problem. it&#39;s a continuous degradation that accelerates the longer you wait. what bad data actually costs you the impact goes beyond annoying bounce-backs. bad crm data creates a cascade of failures: lost deals your sdr calls a prospect who left the company six months ago. the new decision-maker at that account? they went to a competitor who actually knew they were there. wasted pipeline marketing scores leads based on firmographic data that&#39;s out of date. sales wastes time on accounts that no longer match your icp. your conversion rates tank and nobody can figure out why. compliance risk regulated industries face real exposure from stale data. sending communications to people who&#39;ve left an organization isn&#39;t just embarrassing — in some sectors, it&#39;s a compliance violation. the average b2b company wastes 20% of its selling time on activities driven by bad data. that&#39;s one day per week per rep, gone. why traditional enrichment doesn&#39;t fix it most teams try to solve data decay with periodic batch enrichment — a quarterly or annual &quot;data cleanse.&quot; the problem with this approach: point-in-time snapshots — you get data that&#39;s accurate on the day you enrich. by next week, it&#39;s already degrading. no change detection — batch enrichment tells you what a record looks like now, not what changed. you can&#39;t act on changes you can&#39;t see. coverage gaps — most enrichment providers have blind spots. if your contacts fall outside their coverage, those records just stay stale. a better approach: continuous verification what if your crm records updated themselves? that&#39;s the core idea behind real-time enrichment. instead of periodic batch jobs, you run continuous verification against live data sources. when a contact changes roles, when a company gets acquired, when a phone number goes dead — you know immediately, not six months later. the key components of continuous data hygiene: event-driven updates — records refresh when changes are detected, not on a schedule multi-source verification — cross-reference against multiple data providers to maximize coverage change alerting — surface what changed, not just current state, so teams can act on it automated workflows — route updated records to the right team automatically getting started you don&#39;t need to overhaul your entire data stack at once. start with your highest-value segments: active pipeline — enrich and verify records tied to open opportunities target accounts — keep your abm lists accurate and current recent inbounds — verify new leads before they hit your routing rules the goal isn&#39;t perfect data — it&#39;s data that&#39;s accurate enough to trust, current enough to act on, and improving continuously rather than degrading. want to see how fast your crm data is decaying? book a free data audit — we&#39;ll run salmon on your actual records and show you exactly what&#39;s changed.","readTime":3,"heroImage":null}]
